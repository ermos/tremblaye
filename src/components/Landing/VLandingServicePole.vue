      We have five logistics sites where we realize industrial part storage as well as e-commerce. We take care of preparing packages for shipping for the end customer who has placed an order on the internet.
      -  Industrial packaging: We make custom wooden crates for specific and large products. These packages can be several metres long and can carry very fragile products.
      -     Packaging trade: We sell everything you need to transport your goods: adhesive tapes, stretch films, plastic bags, pallets, cartons and protections.
      -     CETEOVAC: We sell and rent vacuum lifting tools to facilitate the movement of panels and windows during construction.
      -     CampinGaz: We sell CampinGaz products (barbecue, cooler, etc.) to campsites and large and medium-sized surfaces throughout western France.
